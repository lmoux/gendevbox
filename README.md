devbox
=============

# Synopsis
This repository contains my general-development setup. I have
decided to normalize on Debian Jessie.

The purpose is to relatively quickly spring new development environments
when I get new computers.

It comes with a projects folder which is where I have been putting most of
my new development projects.
